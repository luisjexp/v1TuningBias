# Tuning of units in Mouse V1

Overview, data and code for assessing Local Tuning of cells in mouse primary visual cortex 

![Alt Text](v1ASSETS/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif) 

Each region of visual space  is 'processed' by a population of units in primary visual cortex [ ]. However, how exactly these units 'process' local image regions remains an open question. 

There are two ideas about how this happens.
1) The classical idea is that groups of units process each part of the visual image with a diverse set of filters tuned to a variety of stimulus features (Hubel and Weisel 1963, 1969). 
2) A more novel  idea is that the units all have a similar set of tuned filters.

The aim of this project is to test these two ideas.
